    "\n",
    "Within the framework of a pilot project of the **Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility**, the aim of which is to provide a personalised urban transport service for people with reduced mobility, we have been commissioned to study the deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles in different towns and cities of the country based on a series of indicators: population size, population density, demand for the service, etc. These autonomous vehicles must have an intelligent driving system that allows said vehicles to carry a series of people from a point of origin to their destination safely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this project, **for the moment, we are asked to design an algorithm that is capable of optimizing the transportation of a person from a place of origin to a specific destination** within a city. In this scenario, the autonomous vehicle will have to navigate a network of urban streets and intersections, where all routes are potentially valid. However, **the system must optimize the path selection** not only to find a valid route, but also to **minimize the travel time**. This implies that the artificial intelligence must consider factors such as distance, the speed allowed on each street and any other relevant factor that may affect the total travel time."
